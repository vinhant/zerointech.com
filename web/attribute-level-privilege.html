                        The permission model in Xellerate 9 uses an "all or nothing" approach when it comes to resource forms.  A user is either able 
                        to change any attribute on a form, or he is not able to change any of them.
                        <p>
                        This is a serious limitation for clients who want the Help Desk group to be able to reset AD passwords but not update any 
                        other attributes (first name, last name, account locked...)
                        <p>
                        One possible workaround is to modify the Struts-based web application and code the functionality in Java Server Pages.  However the 
                        downside of this approach is the steep learning curve required to modify a Struts-based application.  It also makes the 
                        product trickier to upgrade.
                        <p>
                        Another workaround is to by-pass the AD user form and update the AD server directly, using a process task attached to the 
                        Xellerate user process.  This approach is not perfect because it moves the "all or nothing" permission from the AD user form to 
                        the Xellerate user form.  Help Desk Group will be able to change the Xellerate user's first name and last name in addition to the AD 
                        password.  That's why this is a workaround (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaround) and not a 
                        solution.
                        <p>
                        Here are the main steps to implement this approach:
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create Java class and Adapter

                            <p>If necessary create a Java class that will do the attribute provisioning on the target system.  For example create a Java class 
                            that will reset a user's password on AD.

                            Then create an Adapter in Adapter Factory that utilizes that class or that directly provisions the attribute.


                            <li>Add User-Defined Field

                            <p>Add a user-defined field (a custom field to the Xellerate user form), for example "AD Password".  It might also make 
                            sense to re-use one of the built-in fields if the privilege applies to many target systems.  For example if the Help Desk Group 
                            has the privilege to reset password in many target system (AD, Portal, database, etc.) then it would make sense to re-use the 
                            built-in "Password" field instead of creating a new user-defined field for every target system.


                            <li>Add Process Task to Xellerate User

                            <p>Lookup the process "Xellerate User".  Add a process task named "Change Password" (important: the name of the process task 
                            matters!  If the name is incorrect the process task will not be called.  In general the task name should be "Change 
                            [fieldname]").

                            <p>Map the Adapter created in step 1 to the Process Task.


                            <li>Create Group

                            <p>Create a group that will have permission to provision the attribute e.g. Help Desk Group.


                            <li>Add Group Permissions

                            <p>If the class or Adapter created in step 1 uses the Xellerate API to access an Xellerate entity, then permission must be granted 
                            to read that entity.  More specifically the group must be granted read access because the class runs under the context of the group.
                            For example if the class uses the Xellerate API to get the server's 
                            address, port, and bind credentials, the class (i.e. the group) must be granted read 
                            permission to the AD server resource instance.
                        </ol>

                        <p>In summary this approach provides a workaround, with some risks, to the "all or nothing" permission model that 
                        Xellerate uses to update forms.
