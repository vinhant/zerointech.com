My small website hosted on Amazon S3

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a cheap way to host a static website.  No server side scripting supported.  My hosting cost is around 50c a month.

It's been running for years without issue or even logging in to the Console.  This readme.md is to remind me that S3 is hosting my website.
